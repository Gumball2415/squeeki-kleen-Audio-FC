# squeeki-kleen! Audio FC

an open-source hardware external preamp modboard for the NES and FamiCom

## About

A few months ago, I discovered the main source of noisy interference for the audio in the FamiCom, which is the hex inverter chip. The other signals passing through the hex inverter chip is the interference heard in the audio.

Therefore, to reduce the interference as much as possible, the APU pins and preamp circuit must be completely isolated from the hex inverter chip. This is where this modboard comes in.

## How to install

This demonstration uses the RF FamiCom motherboard, revision CPU-07. However, these requirements can be easily adapted to different consoles and motherboard revisions, such as the NES.

The modboard requires that:

1. Pin 1 and 2 of the 2A03 to be isolated from circuit (cut red)

2. The input of the stock preamp circuit to be shorted to ground (solder bridge violet)

3. The stock preamp circuit must be isolated from the path to audio output. (cut blue)

Once these are done, simply install the board underneath the 2A03, and connect the output pad to the appropriate output path. I connected it to pin 45 of the cartridge connector in this example (yellow in the PCB diagram).
